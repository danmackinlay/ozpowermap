A map of where to move in Australia to ensure your voice is heard.

A project of [Dan MacKinlay](https://danmackinlay.name).

[Ben Raue](https://www.tallyroom.com.au/) advises:

>The election results data published by the AEC is already pretty good.
>It’s tidy and easily interconnectable with unique IDs.
>
>Unlike the state and local election results which is why I started [my own collection](https://www.tallyroom.com.au/data) of those results in a tidy format.
>
>All the results websites are available from [the AEC website](https://results.aec.gov.au/) then click through to downloads.
>In some cases datasets are broken up by geography (by state or electorate) but it’s trivial to merge them back together in R.
>
>The House of Reps downloads for 2019 are [here](https://results.aec.gov.au/24310/Website/HouseDownloadsMenu-24310-Csv.htm).
