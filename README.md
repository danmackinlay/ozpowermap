>TBH the election results data published by the AEC is already pretty good. It's tidy and easily interconnectable with unique IDs.

>Unlike the state and local election results which is why I started my own collection of those results in a tidy format: https://www.tallyroom.com.au/data
>
>All the results websites are available from https://results.aec.gov.au/ then click through to downloads. In some cases datasets are broken up by geography (by state or electorate) but it's trivial to merge them back together in R.

>The House of Reps downloads for 2019 are here: https://results.aec.gov.au/24310/Website/HouseDownloadsMenu-24310-Csv.htm
